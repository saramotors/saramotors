    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p> At Sara Motors, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of any personal information submitted through our website, saramotor.com.
        <br>        <br>

        1. Information We Collect
        <br>

        We do not collect any personal information unless you choose to provide it through the “Contact Us” section on our website. When you submit a contact form, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and any message content to respond to your inquiry.
        <br>
        <br>

        2. How We Use Your Information
        <br>
        
        The information you provide in the “Contact Us” section is used solely to respond to your questions, provide requested information, and communicate with you about our services. We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties unless required by law.

        3. Data Security
        <br>
 
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information you submit from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no internet transmission is entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>

        <br>
            •    Right to Delete: You may request that we delete any personal information you have provided, unless the information is required for a legitimate business purpose or legal obligation.
        <br>

            •    Right to Non-Discrimination: You will not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your CCPA rights.
        <br>
        
        To exercise any of these rights, please contact us through the “Contact Us” form on our website or at saramotorsllc@gmail.com.
