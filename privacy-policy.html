<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective Date: 11/11/2024 </p>
<br>

<p>At Sara Motor, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of any personal information submitted through our website, saramotor.com.</p>
<br>
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect any personal information unless you choose to provide it through the "Contact Us" section on our website. When you submit a contact form, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and any message content to respond to your inquiry.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>The information you provide in the "Contact Us" section is used solely to respond to your questions, provide requested information, and communicate with you about our services. We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties unless required by law.</p>
<p>If you opt-in to receive SMS communications, we will collect your phone number and maintain your consent status for the purposes of providing requested information and updates. Your opt-in data and consent will not be shared with any third parties.</p>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information you submit from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no internet transmission is entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<br>
<h2>4. Your California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. Since we only collect information you voluntarily provide through the "Contact Us" section or SMS opt-in, the following rights apply to this limited scope of information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Know</strong>: You have the right to request information about the categories and specific pieces of personal data we collect, use, and share about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete</strong>: You may request that we delete any personal information you have provided, unless the information is required for a legitimate business purpose or legal obligation.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong>: You will not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your CCPA rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us through the "Contact Us" form on our website or at saramotorsllc@gmail.com.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>Sara Motor may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page, and the date of the most recent revision will be indicated at the top of this policy.</p>
